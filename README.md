## Purposes

This is a final project of the databases II and III discipline which I combined into one project. It is only for educational purposes.
The project is a basic sumilation of some activities that a simple shop store need to do:

* Add types of their products
* Add braands of their products
* Add products
* Add Clients
* Add Suppliers
* Add Purchases and Sales
* Search Clients, Sales, Products, types, brands that are in the software
* Some aggregate functions for finding top clients, worst clients, most required suppliers, top selling products (Only availably for Firebird)


The project doesn't create the database on it's on, it need to be done manually with the scripts that are inside the project folder. The
only exception to this is the MongoDB which is using a cloud service in a cluster.
